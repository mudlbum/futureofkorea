"""
Photographic hero sourcing for Future of Korea.

Fetches a licensed landscape photograph per article from Pexels, caches it in the
repository, and records the photographer for attribution. The build composites it
behind the headline (see imagegen.photo_cover).

Design decisions worth knowing:

* **Cached and committed.** A photo is fetched once, written to assets/photos/,
  and its credit recorded in content/_data/photos.json. Later builds reuse the
  file. That keeps builds reproducible, keeps the article's image stable over
  time (readers and social previews hate images that silently change), and means
  CI does not depend on a third-party API being up.
* **Degrades to nothing.** No API key, no network, or no acceptable match and the
  function returns None — the caller then falls back to the typographic cover.
  A missing key is never an error.
* **Attribution is mandatory, not optional.** Pexels' licence requires crediting
  the photographer. The credit is stored alongside the file and rendered under
  the hero; a photo without a recorded credit is discarded rather than used.

Set PEXELS_API_KEY in the environment. In GitHub Actions, add it as a repository
secret and expose it to the build step.
